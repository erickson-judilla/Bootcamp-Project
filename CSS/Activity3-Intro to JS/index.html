				<h1 class="mainh">An Introduction to JavaScript</h1>
				<p class="mainp">
					Let's see what's so special about JavaScript, what we can achieve with
					it and what other technologies play well with it.
				</p>
				<h2 class="m2">What is Javascript?</h2>
				<p class="m2">
					<em>JavaScript</em> was initially created to "make web pages alive".
				</p>
				<p class="m2">
					The programs in this language are called <em>scripts.</em> They can be
					written right in a web page's HTML and run automatically as the page
					loads.
				</p>
				<p class="m2">
					Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. They don't need
					special preparation or compilation to run.
				</p>
				<p class="m2">
					In this aspect, JavaScript is very different from another language
					called <a href="#">Java</a>
				</p>
				<div class="mid">
					<p>
						When JavaScript was created, it initially had another
						name:"LiveScript".But Java was very popular at that time, so it was
						decided that positioning a new language as a "younger brother" of
						Java would help.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						But as it evolved, JavaScript became a fully independent language
						with its own specification called <a href="#">ECMAScript</a>, and
						now it has no relation to Java at all.
					</p>
				</div>
				<p class="ot">
					Today, JavaScript can execute not only in the browser, but also on the
					server, or actually on any device that has a special program called
					<a href="#">the JavaScript engine</a>.
				</p>
				<div class="bot">
					<h4 class="bot2">How do engines work?</h4>
					<p class="bot2">Engines are complicated. But the basics are easy.</p>
					<ol>
						<li>
							The engine(embedded if it's a browser) reads ("parses") the
							script.
						</li>
						<li>
							Then it converts ("compiles") the script to the machine language.
						</li>
						<li>And then the machine code runs, pretty fast.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>
						The engine applies optimizations at each step of the process.It even
						watches the compiled scripts as it runs, analyzes the data that
						flows through it, and further optimizes the machine code based on
						that knowledge.
